# Servo shaker sketch
A simple Arduino sketch that can gently move a servo periodically from one side to another.

Useful for testing motion hardware.

## Setup

git clone this repository into a new folder.

Change the pin definition to whichever pin you have the servo on.

Set the minimum and maximum extents of the servo.

Upload to your device.

## Issues

 - The servo may jump violently to the initial position when power is first connected.
